## topic (5 pts)

In one or two paragraphs, explain the topic of your capstone project. The write-up need not be technical and should be accessible to other data science minors (even if they have not had the same
course background as you). 

I am analyzing the correlation between the appreciation of the Ghanaian cedi and the rise in gold prices from 2023 to 2025. As one of the worldâ€™s top gold exporters, Ghana's economy is closely tied to global demand for gold. I'm particularly interested in whether the recent increase in gold prices has played a role in strengthening the cedi which has appreciated from around 18 cedis per U.S. dollar to about 10 cedis. This project involves collecting and analyzing time-series data on both gold prices and exchange rates, while also accounting for broader economic factors that may influence currency movements, such as inflation, interest rates, and foreign investment.
