\maketitle

For the past few weeks I have been wrestling with the idea of changing
my research topic to one that I can get more information out of and not
just a mere regression. Every week, I meet with Professor Kuhlwein to
explore different possible ideas that I am interested in and that would
also be suitable for a Data Science capstone project. We explored topics
ranging from ``Factors that Drive the Cedi'' to ``The Factors Driving
Inflation in Ghana.'' After several discussions, I decided to broaden
the focus of my project to explore Ghana's key macroeconomic dynamics in
a more holistic manner. Ghana's economy is characterized by a high
degree of resource dependence, with gold, cocoa, and oil serving as the
country's primary export earners. These commodities form the backbone of
Ghana's foreign exchange inflows and they also significantly influence
fiscal policy, inflation, and overall economic stability. Even though
resource wealth offers opportunities for growth and development, it also
exposes the economy to external shocks arising from volatile global
commodity prices. The research that I have decided to work on will be an
exploratory analysis of Ghana's macroeconomic factors, and will focus on
how variables such as inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, foreign
reserves, and major export prices interact over time. By examining their
relationships, the project seeks to uncover patterns that explain
Ghana's cyclical phases of economic expansion and instability. In
addition to this, I have been studying some possible regression methods
like VAR and Granger Causality tests which I will be employing to test
whether fluctuations in gold prices will have any predictive movements
on Ghana exchange rates.
